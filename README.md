# Heatmap and Volcano and Manhattan plot in Python



# What is heatmap?Permalink
Continuous colormap where each color represents a specific set of values
Great way to visualize and identify statistically significant gene expression changes among hundreds to thousands of genes from different treatment conditions

# What is Volcano plot?
Volcano plot is a 2-dimensional (2D) scatter plot having a shape like a volcano.
Volcano plot used for visualization and identification of statistically significant gene expression changes from two different experimental conditions (e.g. normal vs. treated) in terms of log fold change (X-axis) and pvalue (Y-axis).

# What is Manhattan plot?
Manhattan plot used to visualize the association of SNPs with given trait or disease as statistical significance in terms of p values on a genomic scale.
In the Manhattan plot, X- and Y-axis represents the SNPs on the chromosomes and associated p values as −log10[p].
It is a good way to visualize thousands to millions of SNPs o genome-scale. The lowest the p value (higher −log10[p]), highest is the association of a given SNP with trait or disease.
Manhattan plot can also used for visualizing the SNP markers with Fst values (measures for genetic differentiation).
